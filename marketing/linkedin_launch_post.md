Most quantum simulators operate as black boxes, making it impossible to verify intermediate optimization steps or guarantee result integrity.

The Verified Quantum Toolkit (VQT) is an open-source Python framework that solves this by attaching an HMAC-signed certificate to every execution and generating a transparent proof trail for every optimization pass.

This brings necessary accountability to quantum workflows. By ensuring every result is cryptographically verifiable and every transformation is audited, VQT allows researchers to trust their data and reproduce results with confidence.
